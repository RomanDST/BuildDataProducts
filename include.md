This application based on the course project of Statistical Inference class of the Data Science specialisation.

In that project, we investigated the exponential distribution in R and compared it with the Central Limit Theorem. More specificly, we studied the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 exponentially distributed variables with lambda = 0.2.

In this application, we may change the following parameters:

* Number of simulations (up to 2000), 

* Number of exponentials we generate in each simulation (up to 100), 

* Lambda parameter (up to 2.0), 

We may also enter the seed for randomization

The user can choose whether or not to show the sample mean on the plot.

Output

* Two plots that show the distribution of the exponentials and the distribution of the means of the exponentials. The latter should be approximately normal.

* Both the theoretical and sample values of the mean and variance of the average of the exponentials, which should be very close.

* Up to user's choice, a red line indicating the sample mean can be shown on the second plot.
